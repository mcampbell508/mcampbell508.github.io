Hi, I'm Matt. I am a professional web developer based in London working with Laravel (PHP) and other cool things. I try to do things in a fun way, where possible.

```php
$this->ramble();
```

## What I do

- PHP
    - Laravel (Starting with `4.1` up to the latest at the time of writing, `5.5`)
    - CodeIgniter (Experience with legacy code)
- Linux experience, Ubuntu & CentOS
- VueJS and Vuex & some minor React JS experience (with Redux)
- DevOps (Ansible)
   - Experience with server provisioning and multi-site setup
   - Automate provisioning of the local environment from scratch - to speed up those times when a fresh OS is in order.
- Bash theme customisations
- Advanced knowledge of Git
- Improving developer knowledge via documentation (wikis)
- Markdown and YAML experience
