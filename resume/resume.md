Experience
----------

2015-present
: **Shopworks** - Developer

Throughout my time at Shopworks I have helped on-board several new developers into the team.

- Involved with undertaking code review for other team members.
- Vast experience with combining legacy code written in CodeIgniter with a more OOP style in Laravel.
- Comfortable with a TDD approach to solving problems.
- Developed skills with automated deployments and DevOps with tools like Ansible, Terraform and Docker.
- Comfortable with new site setup and server administration, from server setup using Ansible, or things like SSL renewal.
- Very comfortable with Git and advanced features like pull request workflows, rebasing and following recommended [commit message guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Experience and passion for improving internal wiki documentation, which you can read about [here](https://mcampbell508.github.io/2017/12/17/recommended-documentation-for-a-web-team/).

2014-2015
: **YourParkingSpace** - Developer

Starting as an intern for 3 months in my first development role, I was offered a permanent role after a very successful internship.
Working in a small team, I established myself as a valued member of a close-knit team. Working with another co-developer, my duties included making day to day
improvements to the company web application, fixing bugs and adding new features.

- Day-to-day bug fixing, and implementing new feature requests.
- Git experience improved, working in a pull request development cycle.
- Always part of technical discussions within the team for on-going improvements.
- Involved with migration to SSL site version.
- Implementation of Stripe payments API within an instant payment system.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Open Source

- [Git Review](https://theshopworks.gitlab.io/git-review/) - Creator and maintainer. Run tools like [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) and [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) on only the changed files on a
    commit or entire selection of commits on a Git branch. This is extemely useful for large projects, where the focus should be on the changes made in an MR/PR, rather than unrelated code style issues that have crept into `master`, causing a topic branch to fail.
- [Ansible role for installing PhpStorm](https://github.com/mcampbell508/ansible-phpstorm), which I developed to help automate the installation of new versions.
- [Personal blog and resume](https://github.com/mcampbell508/mcampbell508.github.io) are written in markdown and easily converted to multiple formats (HTML, Pdf, Doc)

Programming Languages / Skills
:   **PHP:** Very confident with this language and the new features available in PHP 7.

:   **Ansible:** A lot of experience with this tool in terms of provisioning and using it for deployments.

:   **Docker:** I am aware of the importance of containers, and the role this can play with making scalable applications.

:   Basic knowledge of **VueJS**, **React JS**

- Laravel, CodeIgniter OOP, PHP 7, TDD, MySQL, DNS, Virtual Host, Apache, Ansible, Deployer PHP, Markdown, Ubuntu, CentOS, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Wikis, Bash, Git, Git Hooks
